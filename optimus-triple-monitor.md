An important aspect for me in this setup was to have a three monitors, the laptop's builtin screee and two external monitors.
This can be done on the L502X using the two video cards and the Nvidia Optimus technology via Bumblebee.
The best guide's I found for this were [Sagar's](http://sagark.org/optimal-ubuntu-graphics-setup-for-thinkpads/) and [Gordin's](http://blog.gordin.de/post/optimus-guide)
