# ubuntu-bits

This is a personal repo to hold various scripts and other tidbits for my Ubuntu setups.


- [dell-xps-l502x-pp.md](dell-xps-l502x-pp.md) contains notes and commands for a Ubuntu Precise Pangolin (12.04.3) setup on my Dell XPS L502X
- [optimus-triple-monitor.md](optimus-triple-monitor.md) are notes on setting up a triple monitor setup on an NVidia Optimus laptop and [optimus-triple-monitor.sh](optimus-triple-monitor.sh) is a script for running that triple monitor setup
